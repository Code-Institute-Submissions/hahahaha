Design

Colour Scheme
The main colours used here are black, white, and grey in order to give a sleek, monochromatic feel.

Typography
The Crimson text font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Crimson text is a fun font to use without going overboard.

Imagery
Imagery is important. The large, jumbotron images are designed to capture the user's attention and break up the plain aesthetic of a standard coloured background. They also capture the essence of what I was going for in this project.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and can choose to buy a song with the Call to action button. It is just a single page so it is very simple to navigate.

The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the artist.
